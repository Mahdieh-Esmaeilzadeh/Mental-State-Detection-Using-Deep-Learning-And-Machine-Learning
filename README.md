## Project Overview

This project focuses on **detecting mental states from human speech** using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Human speech contains rich emotional and mental cues, and this project explores how audio features can be used to identify different mental states effectively.

The main goal is to build an automated system capable of analyzing audio recordings and predicting the speakerâ€™s mental state with high accuracy.
